### This is a simple script that will revive the player if dead in prison
1) Before using the script please have a look in the `config.lua` to select your framework (BJCore or QBCore) 
2) Review fxmanifest (Everything that may need chanegd is labeled for convenience)
3) If you are not using bollingbroke penitentiary as your prison you will need to setup the polyzone in `client.lua` line 93 (I will add a config option for the polyzone in the future.)

## Finally enjoy the script and put it to good use
