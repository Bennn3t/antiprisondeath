### This is a simple script that will revive the player if dead in prison
1) Before using the script please have a look in the `config.lua` to select your framework (BJCore or QBCore) 
2) Review fxmanifest (Everything that may need changed is labeled for convenience)
3) If you are not using bollingbroke penitentiary as your prison you will need to setup the polyzone in `config.lua`
4) Add `ensure antiprisondeath` to your server.cfg

## Finally enjoy the script and put it to good use
